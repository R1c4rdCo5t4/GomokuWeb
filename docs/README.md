# Gomoku - API Documentation

This document contains the HTTP API documentation for a frontend client application.

## Introduction

This API is designed to be consumed by a frontend client application, divided by the following entities:
* [Home](#home), the entry point of the API;
* [User](#user), that provide actions such as register, login and get one or more users;
* [Lobby](#lobby), that provide actions such as joining, leaving the lobby and finding a match by a matchmaking algorithm;
* [Game](#game), that provide actions such as making a move, leaving a game and observing a game state.

## Media Types

This API uses the following media types:
* `application/json`, which is used in request bodies - [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
* `application/vnd.siren+json`, which is being used in the response bodies - [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren)
* `application/problem+json`, which is used in response errors - [RFC9457](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457.html)

This API uses [hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia), which is a way of providing information to the client application about the available actions that can be taken from a certain resource.
* All the response bodies contain are represented by a [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren), which contains the following properties:
    * `class`, which is an array of strings that represent the type of the resource;
    * `properties`, which is an object that contains the properties of the resource;
    * `entities`, which is an array of sub-entities that represent the sub-resources of the resource;
    * `actions`, which is an array of actions that can be taken from the resource;
    * `links`, which is an array of links that can be used to navigate to other resources.

* The available navigation links are:
    * `self`: Represents the uri of the resource itself
    * `home`: API Home
    * `user-home`: User Home
    * `get-user`: URI template to get a user
    * `get-game`: URI template to get a game
    * `next`: Next page of a paginated resource
    * `prev`: Previous page of a paginated resource

* The available actions are:
    * `register`: Register a new user
    * `login`: Login a user
    * `logout`: Logout a user
    * `get-user`: Get a user
    * `get-users`: Get users
    * `join-lobby` : Join the lobby
    * `find-match`: Find a match in the lobby
    * `leave-lobby`: Leave the lobby
    * `get-games`: Get games
    * `get-game`: Get a specific game
    * `play-game`: Play a game
    * `leave-game`: Leave a game
    * `get-black-player`: Get the black player of a game
    * `get-white-player`: Get the white player of a game
    * `get-opponent`: Get the player's opponent of a game


## API Navigation

The API navigation graphis represented in the following diagram:

![API Navigation Graph](./diagrams/gomoku-diagrams-navigation-graph.svg)

We highlight the following aspects of the API journey:

* The `home` should be the first request the frontend application should make to the API. This request returns all the links for the actions that can be taken from there.
* If the frontend application is using Cookies for the user authentication, to check if a user is authenticated, the frontend application should make a request to the `user-home` resource,
and if it returns a `401 Unauthorized` status code, the user is not authenticated.
* The navigation uris are sent in the `links` and `actions` properties.
* There are operations and resources that are only available to authenticated users.

## Available Operations

## Authentication

The authentication is made using a token, which is required to be in one of the following headers in a request:
* `Authorization Header`
  * Uses the [Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) authentication scheme.
* `Cookie Header` 
  * Uses the [Cookie](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/cookie-authentication/) authentication scheme.

Each user has a max of 3 tokens, and if a user tries to login with more than 3 tokens, the oldest token is deleted.
The token has max validity of 15 days, but if no authenticated request is made in 3 days, it expires.
When it does, the user should login again to get a new token.
